This C++ program demonstrates an implementation of the Affine cipher, a type of substitution cipher that encrypts and decrypts text using two keys 'a' and 'b'.

The program allows users to perform encryption using the Affine cipher method on a set of pre-defined characters and also allows the user to enter text they want ciphered. It also includes functionality to decrypt the ciphered text back to its original form.

Ensure to uncomment the decryption functions before attempting to decrypt the text.

The program was written with the Affine keys a and b predetermined as a = 11 and b = 13.
